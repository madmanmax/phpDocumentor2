Elastic Search
==============

Elastic Search is the NoSQL of search servers. It is capable of persisting information without needing a predefined
schema. With phpDocumentor we aim to allow users to shape the document as they see fit; to be able to do this a mapping
is needed so that the information from the AST can be transformed into a well-formed document.
